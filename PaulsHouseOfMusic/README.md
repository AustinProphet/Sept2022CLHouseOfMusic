<h2>Hello and welcome to Paul's House of Music!</h2>

<p>This is a simple shoping cart applicaton that can be opened by running the paulshouseofmusic.sln solution found n the main file.</p>
<p>Once opened runing the program will open the WPF window and populate and inventory list which you can then add items of to your cart using the add/remove buttons.
When you've gathered all the items you want you can use the checkout button to total your cart and get a "succesfully checked out message". The checkout button will also generate a Daily Sales log that will be in your bin Debug folder upon exiting the application.
This projects includes the following features from the Code Louisville Project Requirements Sheet:</p>

<ul>
<li>The inventory is read from a SQLite database with one table called Music Equipment.</li>
<li>The Music Equipment Database is queried using a raw SQL command in the Inventory Builder Class</li>
<li>The inventory builder ceates a list of objects of type MusicEquipment and displays it in the inventory List Box.</li>
<li>Once you have checked out your cart and ended the program you will find a DailySales.txt file in the Debug bin that logs the sales transactions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to step through my project and for all of the awesome knowledge that Code Louisville has provided!</p>
